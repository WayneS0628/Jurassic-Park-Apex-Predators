This project is of a Jurassic Park Apex Predators iOS App that catalogs Jurassic 
Park Apex Predators. The app enables sorting by movie  appearance or alphabetically, 
filtering by terrain (land, air, sea), and  searching with a search bar. Detailed 
profiles include images, movie appearance descriptions, Apple Maps locations, and 
links for more information. The app, which also features Dino stickers for iMessage, 
showcases skills in UI/UX design, CoreData management, and API integration. This project 
was developed as part of a course on UDEMY.com called "Learn iOS development with 
SwiftUI 6 and Swift 6; build complete iOS 18 apps from scratch; visionOS, macOS, watchOS".
